      <h1>Dane Natoli</h1>
      <p>I'm a software developer, currently living in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
      <p>I grew up in Melbourne, always interested in computers and the web. The first
      thing I ever made was a Nintendo 64 cheat site I hosted on Geocities when I was 12. I continued pursuing my interest in computers, completing a Computer Science degree at <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au">RMIT</a> in 2007. </p> 
      In 2006 I began working for a small software company called <a href="http://www.hannanit.com.au">HannanIT</a>, developing software
      solutions for various clients around Melbourne.
      <p>After taking a year off to head to <a href="http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com">Whistler Blackcomb</a> for the 09/10 ski season (including the Winter Olympics!),
      I came back to HannanIT, helping transform the software team into an awesome Agile development shop,
      <a href="http://www.lambdasoftware.com.au">Lambda Software</a>. I am currently a Software Team Lead at Lambda.</p>
      <p>While I began my dev career mainly working on .NET/MSSQL desktop applications, over the last few years I've developed a strong interest in
      web dev. I've spent the last year learning all I can about Ruby on Rails, and attempting to get my HTML, CSS and Javascript up to
      a level I can be proud of.
      <p>If you want to know more about me and my work, feel free to check out my
      <a href="resume.html">resume</a>,
      <a href="http://github.com/link664">github</a>,
      <a href="http://twitter.com/link664">Twitter</a> and
      <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/dnatoli">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
      <p>When not sitting behind a computer, I can be found either on the ski fields, in a pub, hidden behind a book or sitting on the couch with an Xbox
      controller in my hand.</p>
